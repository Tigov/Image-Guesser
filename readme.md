Guess the image correctly. This uses the Google places api. To run the code on your own machine, rename envSample to .env and put in your own google places api key. Use node backEnd.js to run the server on localhost:3000. Backend is with NodeJS. WARNING: The images are loaded directly from the api and I have no control over what the api returns... You may find random pictures that dont really show a place.

To play the game go to https://image-guesser-game.glitch.me/ although this is a free web hosting service so it may take a moment to load.
