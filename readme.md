Guess the image correctly. This uses the Google places api. To run the code on your own machine, rename envSample to .env and put in your own google places api key. Use node backEnd.js to run the server on localhost:3000. WARNING: The images are loaded directly from the api and I have no control over what the api returns... You may find random pictures that dont really show a place.
